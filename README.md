This project would not have been possible without the following tools and libraries:

* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): For the great drawing tool
* [Google](https://www.google.com/): For providing the free tools (Google Colab and Google slides) that allowed me to prepare these workshops
* [SlidesCodeHighlighter](https://romannurik.github.io/SlidesCodeHighlighter/?theme=light&font=Roboto+Mono&tab=4&size=40&sel=focus): That generates beautfiul code blocks for Google Slides
